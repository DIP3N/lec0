I sat in the back seat. We went to baba's house, had water, met lalita aie and uma aie, pate kaka, bhimrao baba left for Bhokar. I was sitting in the back seat. along with lalita aie, uma aie. I felt asleep watching chernobyl s01e05. Then we reached bhokar's mangal karyalayak. I changed clothes in a room. Wore kishor kaka's shoes. Attended wedding sitting on the first floor. Then I had lunch at the ceremony with Atharva, Shrawani, Shreejit and Soham. Then I literally passed the time sitting in front of a cooler. Then around 4, We left for bhainsa. I watched chernobyl finale throughout. Then we reached Bhainsa. I went for a ride with shravani. Bought her goodies worth rs.85. Then nothing special to mention. and here i am writing this diary as new HTML project. Later shivaji mama ordered some mutton for dinner... It was amazing!
